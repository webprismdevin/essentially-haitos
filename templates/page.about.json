I did not use sunscreen (gasp) – rather I encouraged the sun to shine my way with baby oil and a reflector shield! Oh boy. <\/p><p>By my mid- to late-twenties I started taking skin care more seriously – a good moisturizer and sunscreen. By my thirties I was battling the onset of wrinkles and began searching for that miracle product to solve all my skin woes – easier said than done! Thousands of dollars later (seriously) and a multitude of nearly empty jars (never quite finished one before the next “miracle” caught my eye) – my skin looked OK – most people said I looked younger than my years. <\/p><p>My forties ushered in the “Sephora Era” and more time and money spent chasing the elusive miracle cream.  Finally, I stepped back, looked at the chemical confusion that was my beauty routine, and realized I needed to simplify – for my skin, my sanity, my time and my wallet!<\/p><p>At this point, Alicia and I began experimenting with natural and organic homemade skincare products – her skin improved greatly and mine, at last, was at peace.  <\/p><p>​The idea for Essentially Haitos came from our mutual appreciation and respect of natural and organic products – the inherent simplicity of the routine and effectiveness of the ingredients - <em>AND<\/em> the results we saw in our skin.  Mother Nature creates our ingredients – as She has for millennia – and they have yet to disappoint. <\/p><p>​I'm not unique in my desire for natural skincare – it just took me some (quiet) time to get here.  Thanks for joining me!<\/p>"

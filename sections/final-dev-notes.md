# Final dev notes

## Updates
- removed Expanded Products No What's Inside template: no longer needed. What's inside will only show if the first ingredient image is set
    - added metafields for up to 4 featured ingredients of each product
- added description copy below "Locally Sourced" section (title currently reads "Simple, natural, effective." )
- hide skn.vst.mnt pre-launch from menu, readd after discussing offer strategy more deeply
